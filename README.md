<strong>Hi there</strong>, and welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Nelson Zongezile Malgas, and I'm currently a software engineering student at CodeSpace Academy.

My passion for coding and software development has led me to pursue this exciting career path, and I'm thrilled to be learning and growing every day.
So far, I've gained experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm eager to delve into new technologies like GraphQL, Node.js, Nuxt.js, Git, and Netlify.
I believe that keeping up with the latest tools and trends in software development is essential for staying competitive and producing high-quality work.

As you browse my GitHub repositories, you'll see that I'm constantly working on new projects and refining my skills.
I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate with others and learn from their expertise, so please feel free to reach out if you'd like to work together on something.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, playing video games, or reading up on the latest developments in technology and software engineering.
I'm excited about the future of this field and the many possibilities it holds, and I can't wait to see where my career takes me.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me, and I look forward to connecting with you on GitHub!
